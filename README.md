# ghost

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game&#41;):

>  **Ghost** *is a written or spoken word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, and usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as three or four letters. The player who completes a word loses.*
